       <p>Anisah Abdullah is an emerging professional interning at King County International Airport. During Fall 2020, she became a student at one of the leading non-profit organizations in the nation that aims to close the opportunity divide, the Year Up Program.</p>
       
       <p> After a rigorous application process, she was accepted into the program and continues to thrive to become a successful Asian-Muslim software developer.</p>
       
       <p>She works hard to pave an opportune future for her children and to be a leading example. She is motivated and excited to see where her journey lands her in the corporate industry.</p>
       
       <p>"I am a driven problem solver, always looking for solutions outside the box to share my creativity and find solutions to contribute to my team. Studying in the software development field, learning and applying the skills I learn every day, and being able to see the progress I have made, is what brings me to love what I do.</p>
           
      <p>I am a motivated single mom, thriving to bring diversity into the corporate industry. As a young Muslim-Asian woman, I hope to show other young women that as long as you set your mind to what you want, you can achieve anything!
      </p>

       <p>As a student at Year Up, I have been given the amazing opportunity to meet and network with people with all different types of life experiences. Making these connections has been uplifting to my spirit and something I will always keep a part of me because I am proud to be apart of this incredible organization."
      </p>

       <p>"Obstacles can't stop you. Problems can't stop you. Mostly, people can't stop you. Only you can stop you." -Jeffrey Gitomer </p>
